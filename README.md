                                            Industry Genres

INTRODUCTION

The movie industry has grown tremendously, especially with the move to streaming services. The aim of this project is to determine which genres are best to produce when starting out in the industry. Microsoft is a big company that can make it in the industry.

This project has used a dataset to check which genres have the highest ratings, the most venue, and also the most views. This will help the company decide how best to proceed with production. They will understand the market better and choose which are the best genres to start a business with in order to make money.

To run the project, you will need to import the right libraries e.g. pandas, matplot to analyze and clean the data. The graphs show which genres produce the highest revenues, the highest ratings, and the highest ratings count.
With the three analyses, one can make an informed decision when they read the information presented.

The dataset used was from Kaggle and it has been of great insight. Statista.com also gave me some insights into the industry on how well it does and how it runs.

SUMMARY
This project has looked at several different standpoints of view and the overall consensus shows that there are three genres that stand out that will be best to start with as Microsoft dives into the video streaming services. Fantasy, Action, and Science Fiction are the best in the industry and they are what Microsoft should invest in.
